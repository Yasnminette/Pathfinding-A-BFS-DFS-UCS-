# Pathfinding-A-BFS-DFS-UCS-

This project was made by following the steps provided by Sebastian Lague and inspired by the code provided on Github. It shows the differents paths and the different strategies to go from a start state to a goal state. Using unity to draw the environment and the different obstacles, you can see the different paths opted for each strategy (A*, BFS, DFS, UCS) using the C# code given.
